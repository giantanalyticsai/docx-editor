'@eigenpal/docx-js-editor': patch
---

Fix font/size/color/highlight changes silently dropping when applied in an empty paragraph (e.g. right after pressing Enter). The mark commands set stored marks before updating the paragraph node, but every transform step clears stored marks — so the chosen value was wiped before dispatch and typed text fell back to the editor default. Reordered so node updates run first.
